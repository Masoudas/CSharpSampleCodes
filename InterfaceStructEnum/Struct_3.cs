/**
Structures are value types, though they inherit ValueType (which inherits object). They act like passing
a class in C++ without pointer. An actual copy of the structure is always passed.

Structures cannot inherit other structures or classes or be used as a base for other structures
or classes. (All structures do, however, implicitly inherit System.ValueType, which inherits
object.) However, a structure can implement one or more interfaces. These are specified after
the structure name using a comma-separated list. Like classes, structure members include
methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events. Structures can also define
constructors, but not destructors. 

However, you cannot define a default (parameterless) constructor for a structure. The reason for this is that a default constructor is automatically
defined for all structures, and this default constructor canâ€™t be changed. The default constructor
initializes the fields of a structure to their default value. 

Since structures do not support inheritance, structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.
A structure object can be created using new in the same way as a class object, but it is
not required. When new is used, the specified constructor is called. When new is not used,
the object is still created, but it is not initialized. Thus, you will need to perform any
initialization manually.

In the following example, pay attention to how structs are constructed

Because structs are reference types, when you assign one struct variable to another, 
you are making a copy of the object on the right.
