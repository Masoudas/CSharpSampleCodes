/**
As we know, all IO operations are based on stream. A stream is a set of bytes,
that can be read from or written to a device (console, file, ...)

At the lowest level, all C# I/O operates on bytes. This makes sense because many devices
are byte oriented when it comes to I/O operations

Console.Out refers to the standard output stream. By default, this is the
console. When you call Console.WriteLine( ), for example, it automatically sends information
to Console.Out. Console.In refers to standard input, which is, by default, the keyboard.
Console.Error refers to the standard error stream, which is also the console by default.
However, these streams can be redirected to any compatible I/O device. The standard
streams are character streams. Thus, these streams read and write characters.

Notice that Stream defines methods that read and write data. However, not all streams 
will support both of these operations, because it is possible to open read-only or write-only
streams. Also, not all streams will support position requests via Seek( ). To determine the
capabilities of a stream, you will use one or more of Streamâ€™s properties.
Also shown are the Length and Position properties, which contain the length of
the stream and its current position.
